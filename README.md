# newtownsqquare
Annoyed that townsquare isn't updating their role list so I'm making this.
If you see the following role on this list, its not avaliable in townsquare:
- Alsaahir
- Balloonist
- Banshee
- High Priestess
- Knight
- Shugenja
- Steward
- Village Idiot
- Hatter
- Ogre
- Plague Doctor
- Zealot
- Boffin
- Harpy
- Organ Grinder
- Summoner
- Vizier
- Lord of Typhon
- Kazali
- Ojo
- Yaggababble

To edit your json to make it useable in clocktower.online, simply replace the role's name in the json (including the quotes around it) with the full text of the role (including the curly brackets)

If you wish to use the python script to fix your jsons for you, it has one input, which is the filepath of the json you wish to fix. Make sure to have a folder named "out" that the script can put the fixed file into.
